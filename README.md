This end-of-studies project presents the design and development of a chatbot that is based on
the content found in "Le monde" articles, The chatbot utilizes natural language processing techniques
to process the articles and generate responses to user queries. The process involved scraping "Le
Monde" international news articles, cleaning the data, translating the articles from French to English
using a pre-trained NLP model, summarizing the article context, extracting named entities, generating questions and answers for each article, and finally using a pre-trained model to match user input
questions to the closest question in the generated dataset and provide answers. The chatbot’s architecture involves the use of several pre-trained NLP models such as T5 and BERT. It has the potential to
provide users with a convenient and efficient way to access news articles and obtain answers to their
questions. Future work may involve improving the chatbot’s performance by incorporating additional
NLP techniques, expanding its coverage to other news sources and languages, and exploring the use
of reinforcement learning to optimize its responses
